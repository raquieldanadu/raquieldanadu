- Hi, I'm Raquie Comboni Danadu Inikutiro from DRC.
- I'm interrested in programming since my childhood, by playing games. Hence I decided to 
- learn Programming.
- I know something about Web programming (HTML, CSS and PHP / MYSQL), Windows desktop applications and OOP
- and I need to immerse myself in.
- I'm currently learning Python and I need help in that field.
